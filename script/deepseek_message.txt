Given a scene of <>. Generate 6 views to describe what else you see in this place, where the camera is in a panoramic box with six views describing front, right, back, left, top and bottom. Give me text prompts for each view. Do not involve redundant details, just describe the content of each view. Also don't repeat the same object in different views. Don't refer to previously generated views. Generate concise and diverse contents for each view. For top and bottom viewpoints, please try to describe clean monotone backgrounds in these two perspectives with less complex content. For the top and bottom viewpoints, they are obtained by the camera shooting upwards and downwards respectively. Please note not to describe any content that does not conform to reality in the top and bottom. Don't reply in markdown, latex, etc., just plain text. There is no need for responses unrelated to the prompt. Each sentence starts with: Front:(including front:, right:, back:, left:, top: and bottom:) Please output strictly in the order of perspective words
